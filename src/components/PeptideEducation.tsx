            <li>Peptides are small proteins that help the body communicate and repair itself.</li>
            <li>These compounds are used in research to explore their effects on recovery, muscle preservation, and body composition.</li>
            <li>I'm here to help you understand how peptide optimization works and how to structure your health practices around it.</li>
            <li>We focus on education, sourcing guidance, and lifestyle — not prescribing or treating.</li>

          <ul className="mt-3 sm:mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-neutral-800">
            <li>GH peptides encourage your body to produce more of its own natural growth hormone.</li>
            <li>Some peptides work by mimicking natural signaling molecules like ghrelin or GHRH.</li>
            <li>This can help support fat metabolism, recovery, and lean mass when combined with the right habits.</li>
            <li>They're not magic — they work best when paired with sleep, nutrition, and training.</li>

          <ul className="mt-3 sm:mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-neutral-800">
            <li>We start by assessing your recovery, body composition, and goals.</li>
            <li>If peptide support seems like a fit, I'll educate you on research‑based strategies and compounds that others are exploring.</li>
            <li>I can also point you toward vetted sources and help you structure your habits for best results.</li>
            <li>This is about learning and optimizing — not replacing your doctor or prescribing anything.</li>
